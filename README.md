Impulse Buying Checker

ClothingRIC designed the Impulse Buying Checker to help shoppers pause before hitting “buy.” Simply enter the product price, your monthly income, decide whether it’s a need or want, and note your current mood.

The tool then calculates how many work hours you need to afford the item, giving you a clear perspective on your shopping choices.

Since **ClothingRIC** is a leading coupon website in the USA focused on helping people save more, this tool was created to promote smarter, more conscious shopping decisions.
